# Kyubey

### Whats a "Kyubey"?
Since my goal was to monitor jobs in Airflow, I thought of naming this repo after the all seeing orb from Lord Of the Rings used by Saruman.
I then found out that orb was called Palantir, so that name is ready in use and has a loaded meaning now, so I though why not call it Kyubey.

### Ok, so why call it Kyubey?
Kyubey is an out space cat thing that grants wishes.

### What? How does that answer why it called Kyubey?
Ok, so you have not seen the original content.
Here is why I called this repo Kyubey:
- Kyubey is always watching, silently monitoring, like this repo for Airflow.
- When Kyubey grants your wish, its not for free.
  It is basically a Faustian power bargain (aka a deal with the devil).
  This repo, both the back-end and front-end are written rust, so hope you like rust.
